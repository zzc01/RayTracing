# Ray Tracing Project 
This a ray tracing exercise project. Following the book “Ray Tracing in One Weekend.” 
<br/>

* Three circle objects. samples_per_pixel = 100. The ray trace time was about 1min.

<br/>

* Final multiple objects. samples_per_pixel = 100. Ray trace time took about 10min. And when further increase the samples_per_pixl to 500 the time it took increased to 50min! Will try to use GPU and Cuda to speed up the ray tracing time.

<br/>

* Some future plans thought:
    1) Can add other objects like rectangle or evern more complicated object shapes. 
    2) Can continue on "The Next Week" and "The Rest Of Your Life". 
    3) Can try to use GPU and Cuda to speed up the ray tracing.
