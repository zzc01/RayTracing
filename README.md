# Ray Tracing Project 
This a ray tracing practice project. Following the book “Ray Tracing in One Weekend.” raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

Future plans:
1) Can add other objects like rectangle or evern more complicated object shapes. 
2) Can try to use GPU and write code with Cuda
